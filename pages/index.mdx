# Basanta Rai

Hey, I'm an Associate Software Engineer at [Amnil Technologies](https://www.amniltech.com/) and a **Bsc.CSIT** student(8th semester).
I consider myself a tinkerer who loves exploring and learning new technologies specially those related to backend development.
In my free time, you'll often find me working out, playing guitar, and indulging in various artisanal pursuits that add a balance to my tech and personal life.
